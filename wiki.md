**Geography** is the study of the physical attributes of the [earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth), its weather patterns, and the distribution of life forms and human societies on our planet. This branch focuses on *human interactions with their environment*. It is divided into **two** main components: [physical geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_geography) (assessing natural phenomena and processes) and [human geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_geography) (examining human activity and spatial distribution). In addition to [maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map), [GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system), and [fieldwork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_research), geographers analyze and interpret the world to help address global challenges and make informed decisions.

## Fundamentals
**Geography** is the study of a subset of [Earth's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) location, places, regions, the movement of people and things, human-environment interactions, spatial patterns, and scales, often using cartography. It embraces an *interdisciplinary* approach to understanding how people and their surroundings are interconnected locally and globally, emphasizing the dynamic relationship between humans and their environment while categorizing areas with similar attributes into regions.

## Type of Geography
In Geography, there are two main branches which are physical geography and human geography and they focus on highlight and define aspects of the Earth's features, between the environment and human.
### Physical Geography
[Physical geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_geography) concentrates on the Earth's natural attributes and processes, encompassing landforms, climate, ecosystems, and natural phenomena such as erosion and plate tectonics. It investigates how these elements mold the environment and also evaluates the influence of human activities, particularly in terms of environmental conservation and sustainability efforts.

In [physical geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_geography), there are a lot of categories that can be define and here are a few of them:
* [Coastal geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_geography)
* [Oceanography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanography)
### Human Geography
[Human geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_geography) studies the distribution of human populations, cultures, and activities and how they interact with the environment. It covers topics like population patterns, migration, urbanization, cultural diversity, language, politics, economics, and environmental impacts, guiding policies on land use, transportation, and urban planning.

In [human geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_geography), there are also have a lot of categories same as [physical geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_geography) can be define below:
* [Cultural geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_geography)
* [Urban geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_geography)
